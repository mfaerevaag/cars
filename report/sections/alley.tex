The alley is the narrow path on the left side of the board, where
there can fit no more than one car side-by-side. As we have solved
there challenge with collision, if two cars was to go into the alley,
one from each side, they would create a deadlock as neither one of
them can drive through the other. To solve this we need a way of
telling if there are already cars in the alley, traveling the opposite
direction. If that is the case, then the car should wait until the
alley is free of cars, and then drive in. Of course, the cars waiting
for the alley to become free must wait in a spot where they are not
blocking the cars coming out in the opposite direction.

As our proof in Promela only verifies that no cars driving the
opposite direction of those already in the alley can enter, they might
still attempt.

This can visually be tested by running any test, as they all drive through
the alley, or simply by starting all the cars.
