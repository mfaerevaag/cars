\subsection{Starvation in the alley}
There is a potential for starvation if the children going in one direction decide to bully the others and always keep at least a single car in the alley, until the others have return to the alley entrance.

This is very close to what the slowdown actually does, as cars outside the alley drive fast to get into the alley again. Thus, the cars waiting to enter have to wait longer.

Fortunately, and due to the variation of the speeds of the cars, there is not starvation, as the cars will at some point get lucky and progress. There is, however, a lot of unnecessary waiting.
