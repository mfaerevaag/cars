TODO!

We have chosen to implemented the extra task ''EXTRA (E)``, and this is discussed in the section ? TODO!

The body of the report is structured such that each section corresponds to a part of the playground - i.e. the field, the alley, and the barrier with and without a variable threshold. Each of these sections contain a subsection describing tests and, in a single case, a formal proof.

\subsection{TODO - the report and where what which where THE WHO? is discussed}
We have structured the report such that discussion takes place in the section (\ref{sec:discussion}) (Discussion). This includes whether the ''Slowdown`` in the alley causes starvation, semaphores versus monitors, TODO!

\subsection{Comment on semaphore versus monitor versions}
\label{sub:sema-vs-moni}
For Step 4 of the assignment, we have made a class for each of the implementations of the alley and barrier, yielding the classes \code{Alley}, \code{AlleyMonitor}, \code{Barrier}, and \code{BarrierMonitor}
